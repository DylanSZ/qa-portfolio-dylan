## 📘 Overview

This section highlights the integration of **Postman** and **Newman** for API testing, focusing on command-line execution and automated HTML report generation. The objective is to showcase efficient, repeatable, and sharable API test executions as part of the QA workflow.

---

## 🏆 Key Achievement

Successfully introduced **Newman** to the QA team for running Postman collections via the command line. This enabled:
- Seamless local and CI/CD-based API test execution
- Automated generation of detailed HTML reports
- Easier test result sharing across teams

---

## ⚙️ Newman Execution in Command Line

```bash
newman run login-test.postman_collection.json -r cli,html
```
