## 📘 Overview

This section highlights the integration of **Postman** and **Newman** for API testing, focusing on command-line execution and automated HTML report generation. The objective is to showcase efficient, repeatable, and sharable API test executions as part of the QA workflow.

---

## 🏆 Key Achievement

Successfully introduced **Newman** to the QA team for running Postman collections via the command line. This enabled:
- Automated generation of detailed HTML reports
- Easier test result sharing across teams

---

## ⚙️ Newman Execution in Command Line

```bash
newman run my-collection.json -e my-environment.json -r cli,html --reporter-html-export report.html
```
