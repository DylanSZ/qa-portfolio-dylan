# Overview

This section outlines the approach for test case management and maintenance using **Jira** and **BrowserStack Test Management**. The goal is to ensure that all test cases are consistently maintained, up to date, and easily accessible—promoting transparency, traceability, and collaboration across the QA and development teams.

# Responsibilities

- Designed and implemented the test case management flow using **BrowserStack**, integrated with **Jira** to streamline test execution and defect tracking.
- Continuously improved the test case maintenance process—migrating from **Excel**, to **Word**, and eventually to **BrowserStack Test Management** for greater scalability and efficiency.
- Created and enforced standard operating procedures (SOPs) for test scenarios, test cases, and test steps to ensure consistency and maintain high documentation standards across the QA team.

# Tools Used

- **Jira** – For test requirement mapping, issue tracking, and test cycle planning.
- **BrowserStack Test Management** – For organizing, executing, and maintaining test cases and test run with Jira integration.
